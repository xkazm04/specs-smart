To create your own tokens on blockchains, you would normally need to learn smart contract programming languages. For each blockchain, you would need to learn to code slightly different smart contracts, in some cases using completely different languages.

With Tatum’s prebuilt smart contracts, you can deploy smart contracts for different types of tokens on multiple blockchains with just a few lines of code. Our contracts are standardized, audited, secure, and will save you countless hours of debugging and troubleshooting. You can easily deploy smart contracts on different chains by simply changing the name of the blockchain in the `chain_id` parameter.

## ERC20

Create your own cryptocurrency, company utility token, or start a new meme revolution and assemble your own Shiba army. With Tatum ERC-20 services anyone can deploy, mint, transfer, and burn  their own ERC-20 tokens in minutes.

### Marketplaces & Auctions

Peer-to-peer NFT auction marketplaces like OpenSea allow users to create NFTs with metadata (pictures, videos, songs, 3D art etc.) and post listings to sell ERC-721 or ERC-1155 tokens. With our instant NFT marketplace and auction smart contracts, you can build the backend to your own peer-to-peer and custodial marketplaces and auctions completely on-chain with just a few lines of code. As soon as an NFT is purchased, the assets are automatically transferred to the seller and the NFT to the buyer, eliminating the logistical nightmare that often comes with building NFT marketplaces.
